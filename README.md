# Computer Security
This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Computer Security. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. Encryption and Decryption in Communication
2. DES (Data Encryption Standard) Algorithm
3. Kerberos Authentication
4. MD5 (Message Digest 5) Digest usage in Java
5. Additive and Multiplicative Encrypt-Decrypt
6. MD5 (Message Digest 5) Digest implementation in C
7. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) Algorithm
